# Alfred Project Plan
Version 1.0-Beta

The first version of Alfred is the minimum viable product. It's purpose of the release is to demonstrate how Alfred works to the community to gain feedback, demonstrate to potential investors, and start early marketing efforts toward key clients and influencers in the industry.
