# Alfred Proposal

## Project Overview

### Project name
> Alfred

### Team members 
- Aaron Anderson
- Ken Hodler
- Morgan Sherwood
- Seth Goldfarb

### What project are you building 
Alfred is a cryptocurrency inheritance solution that helps people transfer their digital assets to their loved ones after they die or 
become incapacitated.

We offer a decentralized solution that facilitates inheritance when the user fails to check-in using our customizable dead manâ€™s switch 
and a service enabling Americans to automate their inheritance by monitoring data reported to the Social Security Administration.

Both solutions enable users to determine when death may have occurred and provide processes for confirming and contesting the death.

### Why did you decide to build it 
People have a plethora of tools for supercharging their day-to-day productivity but when it comes to the pivotal moments in our lives, 
from birth through graduation, marriage, children, and death, we still generally rely on expensive, archaic solutions to manage our 
affairs.

The moment we die, our financial obligations get passed along to loved ones but even in the best circumstances, potential benefits from 
inheritance and insurance generally take 3-9 months to arrive.

Automating the inheritance of digital and financial assets can help people help their loved ones during some of the most difficult 
moments in their lives. In the future, we aim to extend the functionality of our oracle to facilitate other services like fiat 
inheritance and notifications.

### How long will it take 
We aim to launch our unaudited beta version August 1 with a full release targeted for October 1.

### How much funding are you requesting  
$20,000

## Your Proposal 
### Project description
Our goal is to enabling people to monitor the passage of the most important events of their lives and help people help each other by
automating the delivery of services following their occurrence.

Facilitating the inheritance of digital assets upon incapacitation or death represents a critical gap in decentralized key management
and we believe giving people access to data on such a pivotal event can be used to deliver a number of services not limited to 
cryptocurrency inheritance, including simple notifications and fiat inheritance. 

### Features
- Create or Sync Wallet
Create Wallet allows the user to make a Gnosis Safe whose contents may be made available to beneficiaries by entering an Ethereum wallet address. Sync wallet allows users to sync a wallet and make its contents available to beneficiaries.
